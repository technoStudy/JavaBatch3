Note: create all classes inside package "task3"

create class ElectricityAccount with attributes:
1. totalWph -> watt per hour
2. rate -> set default value to 0.7
3. bill

create class Customer with attributes:
1. name
2. electricityAccount

create class Task3, and create a Customer and assign values to all it's attributes and print/debug;


part2:
create method in Customer as "consumeElectricity" with parameter as (wph)
every time when customer consumes electricity, it should add to totalWph
//ex: customer.consumeElectricity(100);
      customer.consumeElectricity(200);
      customer.consumeElectricity(50);

   // customer.totalWph == 350

part3:
create method in ElectricityAccount that calculates bill
where bill = rate * totalWph

customer.electricityAccount.calculateBill();
System.out.println(customer.electricityAccount.bill);

output: 245.0
