Create a class called 'Matrix' containing constructor that initializes the number of rows
 and number of columns of a new Matrix object. The Matrix class has the following information:
1 - number of rows of matrix
2 - number of columns of matrix
3 - elements of matrix in the form of 2D array
The Matrix class has methods for each of the following:
1 - get the number of rows
2 - get the number of columns
3 - set the elements of the matrix at given position (i,j)
4 - adding two matrices. If the matrices are not addable, throw Custom MatrixException "Matrices cannot be added"
5 - multiplying throw runtime exception "Not yet implemented"
